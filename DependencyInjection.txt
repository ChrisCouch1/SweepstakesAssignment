-Dependency Injection on the MarketingFirm class object-

The constructor for the MarketingFirm class included a parameter for an ISweepstakesManager.
This interface is inherited by a QueueManager and a StackManager, allowing the MarketingFirm
to be created using either type of colletion manager. So, if the user prefered either type then
it will be able to accomodate.
